# Display-Notification-

The provided Python script is designed to remind users to drink water at regular intervals. It begins by importing necessary modules, including 'time' and 'plyer.notification'.

Next, it prompts the user to input a specific time interval in minutes for the water-drinking reminder.

The script then enters an infinite loop using a 'while' loop. Within the loop, it uses the 'time.sleep' function to pause the script for the user-specified time interval, converted to seconds.

After the specified time has passed, the script triggers a system notification using the 'notification.notify' function. This notification reminds the user to drink water.

The script continues this process indefinitely, ensuring the user receives regular reminders to stay hydrated.
